                    <h1>Hi Beautiful...</h1>
                    <p>I wanted to put a few thoughts into words for you today.
                        Please read slowly baby, hehehehehehehehe.
                        We may not have a date on the exact day of Valentine's... 
                        I hope this gift I've made for you makes up for it.
                        We'd still enjoy the day like we're together.
                        Being with you makes me think of the most beautiful words, 
                        ones I wouldn't even have thought of if I hadn't met you. 
                        You are the best thing that ever happened to me.
                        At times... I find myself stuck with my own thoughts, how did we get here?
                        One day I'm alone and the next day I have the most beautiful girl waiting for me.

                    <h2>The Little Things</h2>
                    <p>Whether it's the way you smile or how you make me laugh, every moment with you is special.
                        You make every day special. I wouldn't change anything, I'd choose you every single day.
                        I love your eyes when you laugh, I see the stars in them. They look like the moon to me, I'm forever thankful I get to see that glow every night.
                        Your voice is music to my ears, the most beautiful symphony I have ever heard.
                        I'm lucky to be loved by you. You are special to me, baby. It's the little things, that's what makes me love you so so so much.

                    <h2>A Thank You</h2>
                    <p>Thank you for being you. You make my life so much brighter just by being in it.
                        I know the distance can be tough, and I hate that I can't reach out and hold your hand right now. 
                        But every mile between us is just a reminder of how much you're worth waiting for. 
                        You are my home, and no matter where I am, my heart always finds its way back to you.
                        We've had beautiful dates together but I find myself dreaming of our future constantly,
                        the dates we haven't gone on yet, the places we'll travel to, 
                        and the simple mornings where I don't have to say 'goodbye' through a screen. 
                        Thank you for choosing me every single day. I promise to keep choosing you, too.
